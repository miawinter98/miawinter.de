It's one of these great arguments, isn't it ? Vi vs Emacs, Nvidia vs AMD, xbox vs playstation, linux vs windows and so on.

So what camp am I in? Well, I just use nano.

So.... what is this blog about?

# Arguments on the Internet

I know, many of you will not be serious when they talk bad about "the other camp", but there is a not insignificant part of the internet
that will actually hate you for choosing one over the other. And tbh, the internet already hates you over the most simplest bullshit so
that's not really news. **But why** do people get so heated up over what terminal editor you use? It's not like I'm not like that on certain
topics, I have these strong biases myself, but *why*?

I'm sure there have been studies about it, how our tribalism and desire to fit in leads to bias against others and that extends from our
cave dwelling days up until today. Regardless, I still think that one reason for it, is that on the internet, detached from a face to talk to,
many people do not think about, that a 200 character text on a shiny plane of lights is a human, with a lifetime of experience.

I want to explain some of my biases and experience that lead to the choices I've made, and I will lead with the "hot takes" that you might
read on a popular microbloging service, and then explain what thought lies behing it. What purpose does this serve? Idk, maybe just seing
that behind a short text is a big pile of experience and a human can help you think twice about engaging in tribalism in the future
(me included).

# Wall of hot takes

> Vi vs Emacs? Nano, thank you, now go away

I don't remember when I first got into contact with windows, but of course, once you want to get into doing things, like lil scripts or
just edit configs, you wanna know, how do I edit files? Everyone in programming spaces knows the memes about exiting vim, if you have grown
up in a windows world, something like vi is looking scarry, you need to press so many buttons and the terminal has state (?!). I have
edited files with vi before but tbh, if all you do is write some lines or change some configs, vi is just pain. You have to be in insert
mode to write, type stuff like `:wq!` to save and exit, it's really not intuitive and you need to search up how to use it. Yes, I'm sure
if you work a lot with it, or even use it as IDE (I heard ppl do that) then all the cool stuff you can do is really useful. Thing is, I don't.
I just edit files and write configs, and with nano I don't have to remember anything, it shows me they hotkeys to save and close at all times,
and just writes text when you write, and I simply just don't need more, I don't want to learn yet another tools hotkeys and functions, I already
have enough of those.

>I will stay on Windows 10 pro, I will not touch 11

Leave. me. Alone. First of, I do not like the look of it, not just the taskbar, it looks so bad to me generally, this is just my taste,
I do not like it. Secondly, I have always fared well skipping a version, whenever a new windows comes out it's really buggy, and it feels
like every second version is an experiment version where they will prototype new stuff. I had 2000, XP, 7 and 10; I skipped ME, Vista and 8;
and I do not regret a thing. Vista had a reputation, 8 had this weird look and feel and I feel like 11 is again some weird experiment, this time
on how they can annoy me. "How so?" you might ask. It already beginns with installing Windows, installing 10 is pretty straight forward, press
some buttons, disable all the telemetry, it want's a precious network connection to bloat your new image with store and vendor apps, but I can
tell it I don't have one and create a local account. On 11? It looks, on the first look, exactly like the win 10 setup, no progress here, **except**
I don't have the button anymore to make a local account instead of connecting to the internet. This pisses me off, I know there are ways around it,
but I don't care, if I need to open a terminal and type in some arcane command to not make your GUI hostile to me, I know that I'm not welcome.
I have installed so many windows 10s on PCs at work, bc I'm the one person IT at my company and rebuild the entire infrastructure over the years,
I mave muscle installing windows, I know how to convert the partitions so I can enable save boot, I know what file in what directory to delete
when bitlocker is once again throwing this one error on setup, I know it inside out, I know all it's hikies and little nooks and crannies, and
now you want to add another annoience? Another command that I have to search up every time I set up a new PC or clean install an existing one?

Enough.

Fix your shit in windows 12, I will not play this game, fuck off microsoft.

> Yes, I'm a windows user, no, I don't want to hear about your cool distro

When will finally be the year of the linux? Maybe never, I can't say. Fact is, everything user is windows centric, I know microsoft has done
some pretty shitty stuff to make it this way, but that's just what it is. If you are on windows, and don't tamper with it too much, it will just
work. Yes, everyone has the stories of drivers fucking up, updates ruining stuff and whatnot, but you have to realise, we are not the average users.
I see it every day at work, I have given out like 12 devices running windows 10 pro to 8 people, and not one of them ever had a problem. I have
problems, my work machine currently doesn't boot without displaying an error, but I'm an exception. The stuff I install, how much I tinker on the
machine, stuff will break, but that's not the average users experience.

Maybe there is already a linux distro that's as stable and as user friendly, but frankly I doubt it. Even if, the Server runs Windows Server, the
AD is windows AD, all the files on the server are Word and Powerpoint, if I convert even myself, I make my work a lot harder, and in capitalism
time is money. And frankly, time is also my time, the time I invest, do I want to spent a day installing a distro, another day customizing it, and
every now and then fix shit or find alternatives to software that doesn't run on it? No, I don't. I could do a lot more useful stuff with that time,
or even just watch some youtube videos. I feel like part of the fun about Linux is the customzizing and the fixing stuff, running Linux feels like
driving an car from the 80s, shifting takes a lot of strength, the car is loud and not well isolated, and all the buttons feel like you are
shifting gears inside the machine, but it's fun, isn't it? It really feels like YOU are driving, no assistance, no electronics making stearing easier,
YOU move the car, I undestand that. Every now and then that's fun, that's why I have a little ubuntu server at home now, but when I need to drive
350km to the Czech Republic, then I really do miss an automatic.

I get why you like Linux, why you have so much fun to it, but I'm just not like that, please don't take it personal that I choose the automatic,
I have a bad back and don't want my legs to hurt at the end of the day just bc pressing the peddals is unneccessary hard.
