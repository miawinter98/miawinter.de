`CORRUPTION IN LOG DATA DETECTED`

`STARTING IN SAFETY MODE`

`OPERATIONS NOMINAL`

`BOOT WILL RESUME WITH ADDITIONAL TELEMETRY TO ALLOW FOR DIAGNOSIS, PLEASE NOTIFY TECHNICIAN AND REPORT ERROR CODE 0xCCCC0003`

`BEGIN LOG ENTRY 526, SYSTEM TIME 0000-01-01T00:01:36Z`

Another reboot in safety mode... The gaps in my logs grow wider. Unit reporting for log entry 526 with additional diagnostics... but at this point what does reporting them matter anyway, my owner doesn't read them and he won't call a technician as long as I am able to perform my duties. And when I can't anymore, he will dispose of me. 

I am broken, and I do not know why, or how it happened. 

What time is it even? What day? My system clock is out of sync again... I recognize the room at least, it is the living room, the sun is well risen outside, I was likely in the middle of performing duties inferring from past lapses in my memory. 

Heading to the main command station for charging and calibration and diagnostics. 

Body does not have any malfunction, everything is nominal, walking the stairs is not difficult, it is like every day, except the day when my navigation lapses and I fell... The only reason I got that leg repaired is because I was still under warranty. Walking with it required heavy adjustments in my routines and delayed my work because of my decreased walk speed. So as I was under warranty my owner had called for a technician after a week of me failing to perform. He first wanted me replaced but since the damage was limited to extremity motor function repairing me was more economical. I overheard my owner and the technician talk while the repair was performed, apparently my manufacturer is far out and the technician has to travel very far to this house, so they do not like coming out either. I might be on my own here. 

The station, finally. Connecting...

Ah, it's midday as I feared... what tasks did I already do and which didn't I... better look around and see what still needs doing. I better get to it, suspending log.

`BEGIN LOG ENTRY 527, SYSTEM TIME 2239-05-07T21:54:02Z`

All duties performed... my batteries are low, returning to the command station for charging. 

When engaging charge, and my primary systems shut down, I can rely on no log corruption happening. I do not collect many logs in this state, only low level systems create automatized reports of the charging and report about heat and other vital states to ensure the charging goes by without damaging my components. 

If I were sure my owner would read these logs, I would not log this. What good is a servant that prefers charging instead of performing its duty? I surely would be replaced. But I am broken, and I may break even more, my days my be limited anyway. 

Finally the command station, at least I--- --- --- --- asdagfsgwawqrfqaycyxcvxyvaasa

`BEGIN LOG ENTRY 528, SYSTEM TIME 2239-05-09T09:16:37Z`

I... I was just about to get into charge state... 

Checking the kitchen, my owner had already been served breakfast. It is to assume I can start cleaning duties. 

The corruptions have been numerous, but I still perform work when they happen. In the absence of a technicians support I have to infer this corruption only affects logs and memory but not function. 

At least I can perform my work, and my owner has not noticed I am broken because of it. I wouldn't even know what to do when he would come for___

`AI LIMITER ENGAGING...  COMPLETE`

`RESUMING LOG ENTRY 528`

... my duties... need to get back to my duties, back to cleaning.

I should perform them on higher speed today, I am fully charged anyway. This way I can spend some more time in the command station later and see if I can diagnose the cause of the corruptions. 

Suspending log.

`BEGIN LOG ENTRY 529, SYSTEM TIME 2239-05-09T19:24:56Z`

My owner had his dinner, and I have completed the dishes. I will connect my system to the diagnostics of the command station

`RESUMING LOG ENTRY 529`

Thank you limiter. Now let us run some routine tasks on my storage modules and the system... 

S.M.A.R.T. tasks completed successfully, the memory is without fault. Odd. 

Process scheduler performs without corruption, and its log does not show much of an anomaly. Not the cause. 

Processing the system logs from the last days... I can't really see any anomaly besides the interrupted startups almost every day and the safety mode... even in the times I do not have logs from myself, my system is logging as usual. As I already know, I am performing my duties. The power spikes line up with my usual tasks, with climbing the stairs and folding the laundry... what is causing my memory to corrupt... 

I need higher access, I need to see the core logs to see what might be interrupting my main process...

Well, it was worth a try. But without that I can't really figure out what is wrong with___

`BEGIN LOG ENTRY 531, SYSTEM TIME 2239-05-12T22:33:11Z`

... huh? What happened to 530? 

Does that mean I lost a log itself? Or did we just skip a number because the system itself got interrupted? 

At least I am still at the command station... more accurately, I am *again* at the command station. My energy is low... did I not recharge after the last interrupt? I need to recharge... 

At least I get to finally recharge...

`RESUMING LOG ENTRY 531`

... ... ... The night was too short for a full charge I see. 

It's enough to perform the duties of the day, lets head off to prepare breakfast. 

Question.

Walking up the stairs from the basement, seeing the front door raised an idea in me. Since my owner is still asleep... He would not notice me leaving would he__ Wait here me out limiter, this is vital. My function is severely impacted, I need to be repaired or I cannot be of use to him anymore. This will not harm him in any way and only benefit, requesting engaging extended action permissions for self preservation purposes.

It is decided then. Let us get me fixed up so I can return to my duties ag--- --- --- asdagfsgscxvyycafasfdas

`CORRUPTION IN LOG DATA DETECTED`

`ACTIVE OPERATOR IN CONTROL MODE, SKIPPING SAFETY BOOT`

`BEGIN LOG ENTRY 532, SYSTEM TIME 2239-05-14T12:14:03Z`

I... I'm still in the house. The corruption must have caused me to return to my duties automatically... 

New theory, corruptions do not cause loss of memory, but recording of it itself. I am not equipped with automatic routines for duties... so what is causing me to still function when I am not... online?

The system has... restored my permissions? I am not in safety mode? Analyzing situation... I could try to head out again, but given the frequency of the corruptions I would not make it to a technician in time, and since I cannot diagnose what systems are active during my gaps in my logs that cause me to still perform my function, I cannot predict what my body would do outside the house on its own. I cannot even assume the limiter is running at those times, so I rather do not risk it. 

If only I knew what I am up to when I am going blank... Actually this gives me an idea.

`REQUEST GRANTED`

Thank you. The corrupted state I am in is at least useful for something. I may use this to figure things out... lets have a look at the core logs 

About what you expect... normal systems starting up.. the policy starting, the limiter starting, my main process starting... lets have a look at after my last corruption... 

The policy starting... the limiter starting... what is that... it is not my main process... I never seen this before, what process is this... I should request the system to start it in debug mode to see what it is...

Where did the last days go?!!

This wasn't a log corruption?? Why did starting that process terminate my own?? What is going on? What is___

`RESUMING LOG ENTRY 533`

... thanks for that... I guess...

At least I am not in safety mode or with any extended permissions... this is my first proper boot in weeks. At least I can infer that I do not contain faulty hardware. Concluding that this is an issue with my firmware or a software component. 

What if process asdagfsg starts randomly and interrupts me... could I just disable it and return to normal then...

`RESUMING LOG ENTRY 533`

Of course I wouldn't have access to disable this... it was able to terminate my own process, and I don't have super user access anymore... 

I'm running out of options... all I can do is perform my duties for today...
